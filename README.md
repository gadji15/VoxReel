# VoxReel

**Turn voice stories into cinematic vertical reels.**

VoxReel is a mobile-first, dark, premium SaaS web app that transforms a spoken
voice story into a cinematic vertical reel for **TikTok**, **Instagram Reels**,
and **YouTube Shorts**. Speak your story — VoxReel transcribes it, breaks it into
emotionally-arced scenes, matches each scene to cinematic stock footage, applies
motion, transitions, and captions, and renders a share-ready 9:16 reel, while
keeping you in control of every scene.

## Current status

> ⚠️ **Frontend-only UI skeleton.** This repository (originally generated with
> [v0](https://v0.app)) contains the full interface and flow, driven entirely by
> **mock data**. There is **no backend yet** — no authentication, file upload,
> transcription, AI, or rendering. Progress/analysis/render screens are animated
> simulations.

See [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) and [`docs/`](docs) for the product vision and the
specs that guide future development.

Navigation uses real App Router routes. Each `/app/**` page is a thin wrapper
that renders an existing screen component and wires its callbacks to
`useRouter()`. Paths live in [`lib/routes.ts`](lib/routes.ts).

The `/app/create/*` flow shares one typed **draft project** via
`CreateFlowProvider` (React Context + reducer) — initialized from mock data and
persisted to `localStorage` (best-effort, client-only). The **entire create-flow
lifecycle is wired to this state** (all mock):

- **Upload** stores audio metadata, **Style** stores story/language/footage/
  caption settings, **Analysis** simulates the pipeline then populates the
  transcript + scenes, **Storyboard/Transcript/Scene editor/Preview** read and
  edit that shared state, **Rendering** drives `renderStatus` and writes export
  metadata, and **Export** displays it.

It holds draft UI state only; there is still no backend, real upload,
transcription, AI, or rendering.

## Database (Supabase) — schema only, not connected

The initial database schema lives in
[`supabase/migrations/001_initial_schema.sql`](supabase/migrations/001_initial_schema.sql):
profiles, projects, audio files, transcript segments, scenes, captions, clip
candidates, selected clips, render jobs, exports, and event-history tables —
plus indexes, `updated_at` triggers, a new-user → profile trigger, Row Level
Security policies, and private storage buckets.

> ⚠️ The migration is **not executed automatically** and the **frontend is not
> connected to Supabase yet**. To apply it, create a Supabase project and run the
> SQL manually (SQL Editor) or via the Supabase CLI — see
> [`supabase/README.md`](supabase/README.md). Copy [`.env.example`](.env.example)
> to `.env.local` and fill in keys when you begin wiring the backend.

### Supabase client layer

A connection layer exists under [`lib/supabase/`](lib/supabase) (using
`@supabase/supabase-js` + `@supabase/ssr`):

- `createSupabaseBrowserClient()` — Client Components (public URL + anon key).
- `createSupabaseServerClient()` — Server Components / Route Handlers /
  Server Actions (session-aware, cookie-based, anon key).
- `createSupabaseAdminClient()` — **server-only** service-role client
  (`import 'server-only'`; imported directly from `lib/supabase/admin`, never
  from a client component; **never** exposed to the browser).
- `database.types.ts` — typed `Database` for the schema.

Health check: **`GET /api/health/supabase`** returns `{ ok, message, timestamp }`
after a light `profiles` query.

### Authentication (Supabase Auth)

Email/password auth is wired up and **`/app/*` is protected**:

- `middleware.ts` refreshes the Supabase session and redirects signed-out users
  from `/app/*` to `/login?next=…`; signed-in users are bounced away from
  `/login` and `/signup` to `/app`.
- Public routes: `/`, `/login`, `/signup`, `/auth/callback`,
  `/api/health/supabase`.
- Pages: [`/login`](app/login/page.tsx), [`/signup`](app/signup/page.tsx);
  email-confirmation/OAuth handled by [`/auth/callback`](app/auth/callback/route.ts).
- Sign-out lives in **Settings** (`SignOutButton`). Server helpers:
  `getCurrentUser()` / `requireUser()` in `lib/supabase/auth.ts` (server-only).

> Auth gates the routes, but the **create flow itself is still mock-driven**
> (see project persistence below).

### Project persistence (first real data)

The dashboard and projects library now read **real Supabase projects** for the
signed-in user:

- `lib/services/projects.service.ts` (server-only) — `getCurrentUserProjects`,
  `getRecentProjects`, `getProjectById`, `createProject`, `archiveProject`,
  `deleteProject` (all scoped to `auth.uid()`).
- `lib/mappers/project.mapper.ts` — maps DB rows to the UI `Project` shape
  (real `status`/duration; `views` is never fabricated).
- `app/app/projects/actions.ts` — server actions `createNewProjectAction`
  (creates a row → redirects to `/app/create/upload?projectId=…`),
  `archiveProjectAction`, `deleteProjectAction`.
- `app/app` and `app/app/projects` pages fetch server-side; `HomeDashboard` /
  `ProjectsScreen` take an optional `projects` prop (mock fallback for dev).
  Empty state shown when a real user has no projects.
- Settings shows the **authenticated user's** email / name.

### Create-flow hydration & draft persistence

`CreateFlowProvider` now **hydrates from a real project** and persists draft edits:

- `lib/services/create-flow.service.ts` (server-only) — load a project's draft +
  persist settings / transcript / scenes / captions (REPLACE strategy, no dupes).
- `lib/mappers/create-flow.mapper.ts` — Supabase rows ↔ provider state.
- `app/app/create/actions.ts` — `getCreateFlowDraftAction`,
  `updateProjectSettingsAction`, `saveTranscriptAction`, `saveScenesAction`,
  `saveAnalysisAction`.
- A client bridge (`CreateFlowProjectBridge`, mounted in `app/app/create/layout.tsx`)
  reads `?projectId=…` and hydrates the provider (local draft first, else server;
  invalid/not-owned → redirect to `/app/projects`).
- `projectId` is **preserved across every create step** via
  `lib/navigation/create-flow-url.ts` (`withProjectId`).
- localStorage drafts are now **project-scoped** (`voxreel:create-flow-draft:<id>`),
  so drafts never mix between projects.

Persistence save points (mock content, real persistence): style settings save
live; analysis completion replaces transcript+scenes+captions; leaving the
transcript saves transcript; leaving the storyboard / scene editor saves scenes.

### Real audio upload

The upload step is now **real**: in `AudioUploadScreen`, choosing a file (with a
`projectId` present) validates it, reads its duration, uploads it from the
browser to the private **`audio-files`** bucket at
`{user_id}/{project_id}/original.{ext}`, writes the **`audio_files`** row, sets
`projects.status = 'audio_uploaded'`, and stores the real metadata in the
provider before continuing to `/app/create/style?projectId=…`.

- `lib/upload/audio-upload.ts` — validation (mime/ext, ≤50 MB, 5–180s),
  client-side duration extraction, browser upload (anon client only).
- `lib/services/audio.service.ts` (server-only) + `app/app/create/audio/actions.ts`
  — persist metadata (REPLACE strategy); never use the service role.
- With **no** `projectId`, the mock fallback is preserved.

> Still mock: in-app **recording**, **transcription**, AI, stock-clip, and
> rendering. Transcription of the uploaded file is the next milestone.

## Current limitations

- No backend, database, or authentication.
- No real audio upload, recording, or transcription.
- No real AI (storytelling engine, clip matching, captions are mocked).
- No real rendering/export — the "rendered" file is a mock.
- The `/app/*` routes are not auth-protected yet (frontend-only grouping).

## Roadmap

The planned path from UI skeleton to product (details in
[`docs/15-mvp-roadmap.md`](docs/15-mvp-roadmap.md)):

1. **Data layer** — Supabase (Auth + Postgres + Storage).
2. **Ingest** — audio upload/recording + transcription.
3. **Intelligence** — storytelling engine, stock-video search, captions.
4. **Production** — motion/transition engine, rendering (Remotion + FFmpeg).
5. **Polish & monetization** — plans, limits, analytics.

## Notes for future development

- Keep the dark, premium, cinematic, mobile-first design intact.
- Do not introduce backend logic, real API calls, or rendering without explicit
  intent — see the "must not modify" list in [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md).
- Mock data must stay internally consistent (scene counts match storyboards;
  featured runtime is `1:18` / 8 scenes).
- Prefer the shared types in [`lib/types.ts`](lib/types.ts) over inline shapes.
