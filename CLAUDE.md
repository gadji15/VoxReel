## What VoxReel is

**VoxReel** is a mobile-first, dark, premium SaaS web app that turns spoken voice
stories into cinematic vertical reels for **TikTok, Instagram Reels, and YouTube
Shorts**. A creator speaks a story; VoxReel transcribes it, segments it into
emotionally-arced scenes, matches each scene to cinematic stock footage, applies
motion / transitions / captions, and renders a share-ready 9:16 reel — while
keeping the creator in full control of every scene.

See `docs/00-vision-produit.md` for the full vision.

## Product vision (short)

Speak the story. VoxReel handles the rest. Target output: a polished
**60–90 second** cinematic vertical reel, produced entirely from a phone.

## Current status — IMPORTANT

This repo is a **frontend-only UI skeleton**, generated with v0.

- All data is **mock data** in `lib/mock-data.ts` (typed by `lib/types.ts`).
- There is **no backend**: no auth, no database, no file upload, no transcription,
  no AI calls, no rendering. Progress screens are animated simulations.
- Navigation uses the **Next.js App Router** (real routes under `app/`). The old
  single-page `view` state machine has been removed. Route paths are centralized
  in `lib/routes.ts`. `/app/*` is now **auth-protected** by `middleware.ts`
  (Supabase session required); its *content* is still mock-driven.
- The create flow shares one typed draft via **`CreateFlowProvider`** (React
  Context + reducer) in `components/providers/`, wired in
  `app/app/create/layout.tsx`. localStorage is now **project-scoped**
  (`voxreel:create-flow-draft:<projectId>`), so drafts never mix.
- **Create-flow ↔ Supabase hydration & draft persistence.** With a real
  `?projectId=<uuid>`, the provider hydrates from the DB: `CreateFlowProjectBridge`
  (in the create layout, under a Suspense boundary) reads the URL param and loads
  the draft (local cache first, else `getCreateFlowDraftAction`; invalid/not-owned
  → redirect to `/app/projects`). `projectId` is preserved across every step via
  `lib/navigation/create-flow-url.ts` (`withProjectId`). Persistence (server-only
  `lib/services/create-flow.service.ts` + `app/app/create/actions.ts`,
  REPLACE strategy): style settings save live; analysis completion saves
  transcript+scenes+captions; leaving transcript saves transcript; leaving
  storyboard/scene editor saves scenes.
- **Real audio upload.** `AudioUploadScreen` (with a `projectId`) validates +
  uploads the file from the browser to the private `audio-files` bucket
  (`{user_id}/{project_id}/original.{ext}`) via the anon client, then
  `saveAudioMetadataAction` writes the `audio_files` row and sets
  `projects.status='audio_uploaded'`. Helpers: `lib/upload/audio-upload.ts`
  (validate/duration/upload), `lib/services/audio.service.ts` (server-only),
  `app/app/create/audio/actions.ts`. `getCreateFlowDraft` hydrates the audio row.
  No `projectId` → mock fallback. Never use the service role / `lib/supabase/admin`
  for uploads.
- **Real transcription (OpenAI Whisper).** `lib/openai/client.ts` (server-only,
  `OPENAI_API_KEY` — never `NEXT_PUBLIC`, never browser) +
  `lib/services/transcription.service.ts` (server-only) download the project's
  audio from Storage and call `whisper-1` (`verbose_json`, segment timestamps),
  REPLACE `transcript_segments`, and set `projects.status='transcribed'`
  (`audio_uploaded`→`transcribing`→`transcribed`/`failed`). Actions:
  `app/app/create/transcription/actions.ts`. `AnalysisProgressScreen` runs real
  transcription when a project has uploaded audio (friendly error + retry),
  feeds the real transcript to the provider, and **still seeds mock scenes**
  (no real story analysis yet). No `projectId`/audio → mock fallback.
- Emotion colors come from a single source of truth: `lib/emotions.ts`
  (`getEmotionColor()` / `emotionColorMap`). Do not re-inline emotion hex values.
- A first **Supabase schema** exists at
  `supabase/migrations/001_initial_schema.sql` (tables, indexes, triggers, RLS,
  storage buckets). It is **schema only** — not executed automatically, and the
  **frontend is NOT connected to Supabase**. Apply it manually (SQL Editor /
  Supabase CLI); see `supabase/README.md`. `.env.example` lists the keys (no real
  secrets committed; `.env.local` is gitignored).
- A **Supabase client layer** exists at `lib/supabase/` (`@supabase/supabase-js`
  + `@supabase/ssr`): `createSupabaseBrowserClient()` (client),
  `createSupabaseServerClient()` (session-aware server), and
  `createSupabaseAdminClient()` (**server-only** service role — `import
  'server-only'`, NOT re-exported from the barrel, never imported by client
  code). Diagnostic route: `GET /api/health/supabase`. **Still mock-driven — no
  screen/provider reads from Supabase yet.** Never move the service role key into
  `NEXT_PUBLIC_*`; never import `lib/supabase/admin` in a client component.
- **Supabase Auth is implemented.** `middleware.ts` refreshes the session and
  protects `/app/*` (signed-out → `/login?next=…`; signed-in → away from
  `/login`/`/signup`). Public: `/`, `/login`, `/signup`, `/auth/callback`,
  `/api/health/supabase`. Auth UI in `components/auth/*`; pages `app/login`,
  `app/signup`; code exchange in `app/auth/callback/route.ts`; sign-out in
  Settings. Server helpers `getCurrentUser()`/`requireUser()` in
  `lib/supabase/auth.ts`.
- **Project persistence (first real data).** `lib/services/projects.service.ts`
  (server-only) does CRUD on the user's `projects` (`getCurrentUserProjects`,
  `getRecentProjects`, `getProjectById`, `createProject`, `archiveProject`,
  `deleteProject`). `lib/mappers/project.mapper.ts` maps DB rows → UI `Project`
  (never fabricates `views`). Server actions in `app/app/projects/actions.ts`.
  The `/app` and `/app/projects` pages are server components that fetch real
  data; `HomeDashboard`/`ProjectsScreen` accept an optional `projects` prop
  (mock fallback when omitted). Settings shows the real user. **The create flow
  is still mock-driven** — `projectId` is only carried in the URL
  (`?projectId=…`) for a future provider-hydration task.

## Current stack

- **Next.js 16** (App Router) + **React 19**
- **TypeScript** (strict)
- **Tailwind CSS v4** (tokens in `app/globals.css`)
- **Framer Motion**, **lucide-react**
- shadcn-style UI + **Base UI**
- Package manager: **pnpm** (a `pnpm-lock.yaml` is committed)

## Future architecture direction (DO NOT build without instruction)

The planned backend (see `docs/04-architecture-technique.md`):

- **Supabase** (Auth + Postgres + Storage)
- **OpenAI** (or equivalent) for the storytelling engine
- **Pexels / Pixabay** for stock-clip matching
- **Remotion + FFmpeg** for rendering/export

## What Claude must NOT modify without explicit instruction

- Do **not** implement authentication.
- Do **not** implement file upload or recording.
- Do **not** implement transcription.
- Do **not** add real API calls or connect Supabase / OpenAI / Pexels / Pixabay /
  Remotion / FFmpeg.
- Do **not** implement rendering.
- Do **not** redesign the UI or change the dark, premium, cinematic look.
- Do **not** remove the mock data — it is needed for UI development.
- Do **not** break the mobile-first experience.

When in doubt, ask before adding a dependency or a backend concern.

## Coding rules

- TypeScript everywhere; prefer shared types from `lib/types.ts` over re-declaring
  object shapes inline.
- Keep mock data **internally consistent**: a project's `scenes` count must match
  its storyboard length, and the featured "Midnight Betrayal" storyboard
  (8 scenes, `1:18`) is referenced across several screens — update all references
  together if you change it.
- Match the surrounding code style (Tailwind utility classes, inline style objects
  for dynamic colors/gradients, `cn()` for conditional classes).
- Preserve accessibility: `aria-label` on icon buttons, `role="list"/"listitem"`,
  `aria-pressed` / `aria-checked`, `aria-live` on progress.
- Keep components client-side where they already are (`'use client'`).

### Supabase client layer (`lib/supabase/`)

- `index.ts` exports the safe clients only: `createSupabaseBrowserClient`,
  `createSupabaseServerClient`. The **admin** client is NOT exported here.
- `admin.ts` is **server-only** (`import 'server-only'`). Import it directly and
  only from server code. It uses the service role key (bypasses RLS).
- `env.ts` validates env vars and throws clear errors (variable names only,
  never values). `database.types.ts` holds the typed `Database` schema.

### Create-flow state

- `useCreateFlow()` (from `components/providers/CreateFlowProvider`) exposes the
  shared draft + typed actions (`setStoryStyle`, `updateScene`, `addScene`,
  `lockScene`, `replaceSceneClip`, `resetCreateFlow`, …) plus `projectId` (the
  real Supabase id, or `null` in mock mode) and `hydrateDraft()`. Only usable
  **inside `/app/create/*`** (the provider does not wrap Home/Projects/Settings).
- The **full create-flow lifecycle is now connected** (still 100% mock):
  - AudioUpload → `setAudioMetadata` (mock file metadata) on continue.
  - StyleSelection → `storyStyle`, `language`, `visualSource`, `captionStyle`.
  - Analysis → simulates the pipeline, then populates `transcript` + `scenes`.
  - TranscriptReview → reads/edits `transcript`.
  - Storyboard → reads `scenes` (count/duration/add).
  - SceneDetailEditor → caption/motion/transition/clip/lock + missing-scene
    fallback.
  - Preview → reads title/scene count/duration.
  - Rendering → drives `renderStatus` (`rendering` → `complete`) and writes
    `export` metadata (fileName/duration/resolution/quality/size/format/createdAt).
  - Export → reads `export` metadata + project title, with safe fallbacks.

### Routing notes

- Each `app/app/**/page.tsx` is a thin client wrapper that renders an existing
  screen from `components/screens/` and supplies its `onNext` / `onBack` /
  `onCreateReel` callbacks via `useRouter()` — screens were not rewritten.
- The shared shell (`components/layout/VoxReelAppShell.tsx`) derives the active
  nav tab from `usePathname()` and navigates with the router.
- Use `ROUTES` from `lib/routes.ts` instead of hardcoding path strings.

## How to run the project

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev          # http://localhost:3000
```

## How to test / build

```bash
pnpm lint         # ESLint
pnpm build        # production build (type-checks the project)
pnpm start        # serve the production build
```

There is no unit-test suite yet; "testing" today means lint + build + manually
clicking through the flow in the browser.

## Next recommended tasks

See `docs/16-claude-code-tasks.md` for the maintained backlog. Highlights:

1. ~~Migrate to the App Router~~ ✅ done (routes under `app/app/*`, `lib/routes.ts`).
2. ~~Centralize the emotion → color map~~ ✅ done (`lib/emotions.ts`).
3. ~~Shared create-flow draft state~~ ✅ done (`CreateFlowProvider`).
4. Extract design tokens (colors/typography) into documented constants.
5. Connect the remaining create steps (upload/analysis/rendering/export) to the
   provider once their lifecycle is defined.

Keep `docs/16-claude-code-tasks.md` updated as work is completed.
